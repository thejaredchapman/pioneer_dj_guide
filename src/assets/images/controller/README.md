4. Save as JPG or PNG with the exact names listed above
5. Recommended resolution: 1920x1080 or higher

## Finding Reference Images

If you don't own a DDJ-FLX4:

- **Official Source**: https://www.pioneerdj.com/en-us/product/controller/ddj-flx4/
- **YouTube**: Search for "DDJ-FLX4 setup" or "DDJ-FLX4 tutorial"
- **Manual**: Download the official manual for labeled diagrams

## Example Annotations

Each photo should have:
- Red or yellow arrows pointing to controls
- White text boxes with clear labels
- Consistent styling across all photos

Example for jog-wheels.jpg:
```
[Arrow pointing to top surface] → "Touch here to scratch"
[Arrow pointing to outer ring] → "Rotate to scan track"
[Arrow pointing to vinyl button] → "Vinyl mode toggle"
```

## After Adding Photos

1. Run `npm start` to test the application
2. Navigate to Lesson 1 - Controller Layout
3. Verify images load correctly in each step
4. Check that annotations are clearly visible

## Need Help?

The app will gracefully fallback to text labels if photos are missing, but adding photos greatly enhances the learning experience!
